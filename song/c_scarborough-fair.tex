\Ch{ami}{Are} you going to \Ch{G}{Scar}borough \Ch{ami}{Fair} ?

\Ch{C}{Par}sley, \Ch{ami}{sage}, \Ch{C}{rosema}\Ch{D}{ry,} and \Ch{ami}{thyme.}

Re\Ch{ami}{mem}ber \Ch{C}{me }to the one who lives \Ch{G}{the}re.

\Ch{ami}{She} once \Ch{G}{was} a true love of \Ch{ami}{mine}.

\end{SBVerse}

\begin{SBVerse}

Tell her to make me a cambric shirt:

Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;

Without no seams nor needlework,

When she'll be a true love of mine.

\end{SBVerse}

\begin{SBVerse}

Tell her to find me an acre of land:

Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;

Between the salt water and the sea strands;

Then she'll be a true love of mine.

\end{SBVerse}

\begin{SBVerse}

Are you going to Scarborough Fair ?

Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme.

Remember me to the one who lives there.

She once was a true love of mine.

\end{SBVerse}
