\begin{song}{It's a long way to Tipperary}{C}{Jack Judge, Harry Williams}

\begin{SBVerse}

\Ch{C}{U}p to mighty London Came an Irishman one \Ch{G}{d}ay.

\Ch{C}{A}s the streets are paved with gold \Ch{B7}{sure}, everyone was \Ch{emi}{gay}

\Ch{C}{S}inging songs of Piccadilly \Ch{B7}{Strand} and Leicester \Ch{emi}{Square}

Till \Ch{E7}{Paddy} got ex\Ch{D}{cited,} Then he \Ch{D7}{shouted} to them \Ch{G}{there:}
\end{SBVerse}

\begin{SBChorus}
It's a \Ch{C}{long way} to Tipperary, It's a \Ch{F}{long way} to \Ch{C}{go.}

It's a long way to Tipperary To the \Ch{D}{sweetest} \Ch{D7}{girl} I \Ch{G}{know!}

\Ch{C}{Goodbye,} Piccadil\Ch{C7}{ly,} \Ch{F}{Farewell,} Leicester \Ch{E7}{Square!}

It's a \Ch{C}{long} long way to Tippe\Ch{F}{rar}\Ch{C}{y,}

but \Ch{D}{my heart's} \Ch{G}{right} \Ch{C}{there}.
\end{SBChorus}

\begin{SBVerse}

Paddy wrote a letter To his Irish Molly-O,

Saying, Should you not receive it, Write and let me know!

If I make mistakes in spelling, Molly, dear, said he,

Remember, it's the pen that's bad, Don't lay the blame on me!

\end{SBVerse}

\begin{SBVerse}

Molly wrote a neat reply To Irish Paddy-O,

Saying Mike Maloney Wants to marry me, and so

Leave the Strand and Piccadilly Or you'll be to blame,

For love has fairly drove me silly: Hoping you're the same!

\end{SBVerse}
