There \Ch{ami}{is a }\Ch{C}{house} in \Ch{D}{New} Orleans\Ch{F}{,}

they \Ch{ami}{call} the \Ch{C}{Ri}sing \Ch{E}{Sun},

and it's \Ch{ami}{been} the \Ch{C}{ruin} of \Ch{D}{many} a poor \Ch{F}{boy},

\begin{SBVerse}

My mother was a tailor,

she sewed my new blue jeans.

My father was a gamblin' man

down in New Orleans.

\end{SBVerse}

\begin{SBVerse}

Now the only thing a gambler needs

is a suitcase and a trunk,

and the only time he'll be satisfied

is when he's all a-drunk.

\end{SBVerse}

\begin{SBVerse}

Oh mother, tell your children

not to do what I have done.

Spend your lives in sin and misery

in the house of the Rising Sun

\end{SBVerse}

\begin{SBVerse}

Well I've got one foot on the platform,

the other foot on the train,

I'm going back to New Orleans

to wear that ball and chain

\end{SBVerse}

\begin{SBVerse}

Well there is a house in New Orleans,

they call the Rising Sun,

And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy,

and God, I know I'm one.

\end{SBVerse}
