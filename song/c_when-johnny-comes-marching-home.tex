\begin{SBVerse}

When \Ch{ami}{Johnny} comes marching home again Hu\Ch{emi}{rrah}! Hurrah!

We’ll \Ch{ami}{give} him a hearty welcome then Hu\Ch{emi}{rrah}! Hurrah!

The \Ch{C}{men} will cheer, the \Ch{G}{boys} will shout,

And the \Ch{ami}{ladies} they will \Ch{emi}{all} turn out,

And we’ll \Ch{C}{all} \Ch{G}{feel} \Ch{ami}{gay} \Ch{emi}{when} \Ch{ami}{Johnny} comes marching home.

\end{SBVerse}

\begin{SBVerse}

The old churchbell will peel with joy Hurrah Hurrah!

To welcome home our darling boy Hurrah Hurrah!

The village lads and lassies say

With roses they will strew the way

And we’ll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home

\end{SBVerse}

\begin{SBVerse}

Get ready for the jubilee Hurrah Hurrah!

We’ll give the hero three times three Hurrah Hurrah!

The laurel wreath is ready now

To place upon his loyal brow

And we’ll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home

\end{SBVerse}

\begin{SBVerse}

Let love and friendship on that day Hurrah Hurrah!

Their choicest treasures then display Hurrah Hurrah!

And let each one perform his part

To fill with joy the warriors heart

And we’ll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home

\end{SBVerse}
