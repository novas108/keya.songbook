\begin{song}{Seminole Wind}{D}{John Anderson}

\begin{SBVerse}

\Ch{[emi,G,D,A]}{}

Ever since the days of old

Men would search for wealth untold

They'd dig for silver and for gold

And leave the empty holes

And way down south in the Everglades

Where the black water rolls and the saw grass waves

The eagles fly and the otters play

In the land of the Seminole

\end{SBVerse}

\begin{SBChorus}

So blow, blow Seminole wind

Blow like you're never gonna blow again

I'm callin' to you like a long-lost friend

But I know who you are

And blow, blow from the Okeechobee

All the way up to Micanopy

Blow across the home of the Seminole

The alligator and the gar

\end{SBChorus}

\begin{SBVerse}

Progress came and took its toll

And in the name of flood control

They made their plans and they drained the land

Now the Glades are goin' dry

And the last time I walked in the swamp

I stood up on a cyprus stump

I listened close and I heard the ghost

Of Oseola cry

\end{SBVerse}

\begin{SBChorus}

\end{SBChorus}

\end{song}
